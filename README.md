# Mining-Student-Data-to-Predict-Result
Machine Learning Final Project

This project aims to develop a predictive model to predict the academic performance of mining students using student data. We analyze a dataset of student records from a high school in the Portugal. To conduct this research, supervised and numeric data were collected from Kaggle having 395 instances, 28 attributes and 1 class attribute. The dataset has no missing values. The final dataset was generated by eliminating outliers and scaling the data. 

We used Na√Øve bayes, KNN, SVM, Kernel SVM, ANN, Logistic Regression, Decision tree and Random Forest classifiers to build different models. The training and test set ratio was 75:25. Among them, Decision tree and Random Forest algorithm performed best with 100% accuracy on test dataset. Lastly, ROC curve and AUC are also compared among applied algorithms. A dataset with large number of instances would be compatible to analyze the performance metrices more accurately.
